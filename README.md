# Self Driving car term2
CarND term2 sensor fusion, localization and control

* **Extended Kalman Filter** -- Use EKF, lidar and radar measurements to track the car's position and velocity.
* **Unscented Kalman Filter** -- Use UKF, lidar and radar measurements to track the car's position and velocity. This UKF method is more accurate than EKF.
* **Particle Filter Localization** -- Localize the vehicle in 2D map by Particle Filter.
* **PID Control** -- PID control the car in a simulator.
* **MPC Control** -- MPC control the car in a simulator, which performs better than PID.
